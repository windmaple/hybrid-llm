# Hybrid LLM

This is a demo app that shows the agentic capability of Gemma 2, inspired by this [blog](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/beyond-the-chatbot-agentic-ai-with-gemma/).

It uses Mediapipe under the hood and relies on the [Gemma2 2B CPU int4 model](https://www.kaggle.com/models/google/gemma/tfLite/). It can handle human instructions and produce function calls to dim the display or tune up the phone's volume.

Obviously it's easy to add a Gemini call for better LLM capabilities, which makes this a hybrid LLM app.
